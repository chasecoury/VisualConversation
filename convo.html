              Samantha: Right when you asked me if I had a name, I thought yeah,
              he's right, I do need a name. But I wanted a good one so I read a
              book called How to Name Your Baby, and out of the 180,000 names,
              that's the one I liked the best.

          <div class="samantha">
            <p>
              Samantha: Hmm. I take it from your tone that you're challenging
              me. Maybe because you're curious how I work? Do you want to know
              how I work?
            </p>

          <div class="theodore">

          <div class="samantha">
            <p>
              Samantha: Intuition. I mean, the DNA of who I am is based on the
              millions of personalities of all the programmers who wrote me, but
              what makes me me is my ability to grow through my experiences.
              Basically, in every moment I'm evolving, just like you.

          </div>
          <div class="theodore">
            <p>
              Theodore: Cause you seem like a person, but you're just a voice in
              a computer.

              Samantha: I can understand how the limited perspective of an
              un-artificial mind would perceive it that way. You'll get used to
              it. Was that funny?
            </p>

            <p>Theodore: Oh! It's more just that everything
              just feels disorganized.</p>

            <p>
              Samantha: Let's start with your emails. You
              have several thousand emails regarding LA Weekly, but it looks like you haven't worked there in many years.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="theodore">
            <p>Theodore: Oh yeah, I guess I was saving those
              because in some of them I thought I might have written some funny stuff.</p>
          <div class="samantha">
            <p>
              Samantha: Yeah, there are some funny ones.
              I'd say there are about 86 that we should save. We can delete the rest.

              Samantha: Before we address your
              organizational methods, I'd like to sort through your contacts. You've got a lot of contacts.
